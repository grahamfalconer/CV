I'm a fullstack developer and graduate of <a href="https://makers.tech/"> Makers Academy </a> in London. I love to build and create technology! My journey into tech has seen me be a geography student, management consultant as well as a climate change activist. I am passionate about making impactful change and am enthusiastic about the work I do. My favourite technologies to work with are React (Native or JS), Javascript and CSS and I really enjoy working in teams, feel free to send me a message if you are interested in working on a project together!

**Strong communication** - - I have always been recognised as an optimistic and outgoing person by my peers and have often been put forward for roles involving demonstrations, negotiations, and public speaking. As well as this I also won the <a href="https://rotary1070.org/youth/competitions/y-speaks/"> Rotary Youth Speaks </a> Public Speaking Award (2015) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_United_Nations"> Model United Nations Debate (2016) </a>. Practicing my communication in this way has allowed me to become a great story-teller who can help motivate and inspire with my words as well as articulate the natures of complex problems.

**Adaptability** -  Having lived in 6 countries by the age of 22 and having gone from being a geography student at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Birmingham"> University of Birmingham </a> to a Strategy Consultant at <a href="https://www.scientrix.com/"> Scientrix </a> then a Software Developer at Makers, it is fair to see change is something I welcome with open arms and stay excited about. This has allowed me to feel comfortable when arriving in new environments and taking on new technologies.

**Creative Problem Solving** - When confronted with complex problems I will often resort to my creativity and intuition to solve them. This has enabled me to think differently to other members of my groups and allowed me to provide potent outside of the box solutions which are regularly incorporated into projects, such as my custom event listeners which featured in <a href="http://mission-ctrl.surge.sh/"> Mission-Ctrl </a>.

1: **Love what you do:** I am an incredibly passionate person and let my flooding enthusiasm be a driving force in everything I do, this has enabled me to really push myself in challenging situations, such as a career change into tech. By completely immersing myself in everything technology, including; books, projects, television shows and more!

2: **Honest feedback is the best feedback:** As someone who values self progression a great deal and is always trying new things to improve, honest feedback is something I see as crucial, especially at this stage in my career it is important that it's made clear to me what works so that I can include it in future recipes for success.

3: **Always listen to the little guy:** I am an empathetic person and feel a personal desire to see others around me feel comfortable in the space they are in as this is when people are going to work best for you and themselves.
