I am a British South-African, Full Stack Developer and graduate of the Makers Academy Bootcamp in London. I am currently looking for a job as a Junior Developer so that I can build on these skills, learn new things and to help make valid contribution to a company's success. 

At Makers, I enjoyed an incredible shift in the the spectrum of what of what I thought I was capable of and have become more passionate about problem solving then ever before. I am now looking for a company which has a great culture and is excited about their vision so that I can can help them as they help me on my journey!
 
My main interests in tech at the moment are machine learning, data science and AI.

<h2 id="Skills"> Skills </h2>

**Problem-solver** - Tech is providing me with an awesome scope of challenges, each one allowing me to utilize a subset of problem-solving skills, such as my curiosity, determination, and idea-formulation. This was present in my Maker's challenges as I actively came up with new ways to debug the problem and provided innovative solutions of my own that would help us move forward.

**Good communicator** - I have always been recognized as an optimistic and outgoing person by my peers and have regularly been put forward for roles involving demonstrations, negotiations, and public speaking. This has allowed me to become a great story-teller who can help motivate and inspire with my words.

**Flexible** - This is arguably the skill I resonate with the most, having lived in 6 different countries by the age of 22 (New Zealand, South Africa, Kuwait, Bahrain, England & Scotland) I am no stranger to change and the difficulties that come with it. I have always been quick to establish and integrate myself into new cultures. This was present during my move from school in Cape Town to Sutton Valence, wherein my 2 years I became an active member in multiple sports teams and other societies where I was able to represent my school.

**Enthusiastic** - Tech has been an exciting whirlwind for me thus far and I have found enthusiasm to be my enabler in the work I do and believe in sharing that enthusiasm with the team for best results. As mentioned in Steven R. Covey's '7 Habits of Highly Effective People' 'We work best when others work well', this was present during my work on the final project at Makers where I regularly made sure everyone focussed on the wonder and the challenge aspect of what we were doing so that people felt energized going into their tasks.

**Culture Oriented** - I believe in maintaning a great culture in any workplace I am in as it provides a fundamental base for community and helps motivate and get the best out of people. Working environments are often rich with culture due to the nature of how unique companies and employee's are. I believe I have developed skills in cultural understanding during my time at university where I learned about culture, identities and how to construct public space to be inclusive for all people. I believe this knowledge has begun to resonate with me as a workplace skill due to how I feel I use it in balancing teams and trying to build visions around projects.

<h2 id="Experience"> Experience </h2>

<h3> Makers Academy (February 2020 - June 2020) </h3> 

*Junior Developer*  

During my time on the course I got to practise some fundamental programming processes such as; 

**T.D.D** : I would write tests for the code that I wrote. This allowed me to be able to solve complex problems through a methodical process as well as stay organised and ontop of task at hand.

**Agile Workflow** : Events such as standups, scrums and check-ins were used regularly. This is to follow modern methodologies on how we should programme and to help to abide by the Extreme Programming Principles; feedback, respect, courage, communication and simplicity.


As well as build on the foundation of understanding I had of O.D.D, the MVC and how my code should all fit and work together. 



<h3> Minutz Management (Work experience) </h3>
