## Graham Falconer
I am a British South-African, Full Stack Developer and graduate of the Makers Academy Bootcamp in London. During my time at Makers, I enjoyed an incredible shift in the the spectrum of what of what I thought I was capable of and have become more passionate about problem solving then ever before. I am currently looking for a job as a Junior Developer so that I can build on the skills, learn new things and to help make valid contribution to a company's success. 

I am looking for a company which has a great culture and is excited about their vision so that I can can help them as they help me on our journeys. My main interests in tech at the moment are machine learning, data science and AI.

## Skills

**Problem-solver** -Tech is providing me with an awesome scope of challenges, each allowing me to utilise a subset of problem-solving skills I have such as my curiosity, determination and idea-formulation. This was present in my Makers challenges as I actively came up with new ways to debug the problem and provided innovative solutions of my own that would help us move forward.

**Good communicator** - I have always been recognised as an optimistic and outgoing person by my peers and have regularly been put forward for roles involving demonstrations, negotiations and public-speaking. This has allowed me to become a great story-teller who can help motivate and inspire with my words.

**Flexibility** - This is arguably the skill I resonate with the most, having lived in 6 different countries by the age of 22 (New Zealand, South Africa, Kuwait, Bahrain, England & Scotland) I am no stranger to change and the difficulties that come with it. I have always been able to quickly establish and integrate myself into new cultures. This was present during my move from school in Cape Town to Sutton Valence where in my 2 years I became an active member in multiple sports teams and other societies where I was be able to represent the school.

**Enthusiastic** - Tech has been an exciting whirlwind for me thus far and I have found enthusiasm to be my enabler in the work I do and believe in sharing that enthusiasm with the team for best results. This was present during my work on the final project at Makers where I regularly made sure everyone focussed on the wonder and the challenge aspect of what we were doing so that people felt energised going into their tasks. 

**Culture Oriented** - public space, geography, study of culture, talked about cultureâ€¨Public speaker - could go into good communicator but I have a lot on it.
