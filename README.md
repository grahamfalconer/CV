## Graham Falconer
I am a Full Stack Developer and a graduate of the Makers Academy Bootcamp in London. During my time at Makers, I enjoyed an incredible shift in the the spectrum of what of what I thought I was capable of and have become more passionate about problem solving then ever before! Importantly, makers also allowed me to build up on and practice skills I already had, such as creating balance within a team and ensuring passion and enthusiasm for the task is present. My main interests in tech at the moment are machine learning, data science and AI.

## 1. Skills

Flexibility - This is arguably the skill I resonate with the most, having lived in 6 different countries by the age of 22 (New Zealand, South Africa, Kuwait, Bahrain, England & Scotland) I am no stranger to change and the difficulties that come with it. This has toughened my character given me a state of inspiration, wonder and hope which I try to let shine through on my tech.
-Experience
-Achievement
-Evidence

Enthusiasm - Tech has been an exciting whirlwind for me thus far and I have found that ethusiasm to be my enabler in the work I do, I believe in keeping a positive mental and attitude and to let uneccesary stress go so that you may focus on the task at hand (this is something I have also practiced during meditation)
-Experience
-Achievement
-Evidence

Trusting and trustworthy - I am believer in trusting in your partner and that is why I usually deal with complete transparency about how I feel in the way I work, this allows me to make correct adjustments and allows me to deal in greater accuracy with the work I do.
-Experience
-Achievement
-Evidence

Curiosity - This is another skill I find I highly resonate with, my curiosity is what has lead me into the realms of tech in which I can explore learning in a way that profits my career in the long-term which is something I find super awesome and us another reason why I love tech.
